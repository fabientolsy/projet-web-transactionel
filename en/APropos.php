      <p class="paragraphe1">Hello, we are three friends who started a project to earn money by
        selling projects<br> such as video games or software. We sell our own projects there.
        Obviously this has a cost,<br> paying servers out of pocket, giving of our time. But despite that sell yours
        game on our site<br> costs you nothing and even pays you!</p>

        What do we do
        <small class="text-muted">?</small>
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraphe2">We allow you in a few clicks! To put your game/software on sale, whatever
        either the magnitude of<br> the project you can put it at the price you want. We don't take a big margin
        as could<br> to do it with big resellers, the idea is to limit the margin that we take, to provide for the
        monetary needs,<br> servers or other expenses that could improve the customer's experience. It is
        the independent spirit that is<br> highlighted.</p>
